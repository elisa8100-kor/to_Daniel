Dear Cousin,
<br><br>
Hi! I hope you are doing well. Do you remember when we played chess together in Australia, sitting across from each other and taking turns? I still remember that time clearly.
<br><br>
I was thinking it would be nice to play chess with you again. This time, I was wondering if we could try correspondence chess. We can send one move at a time by message and take as long as we want to think.
<br><br>
We don’t need to hurry, and it doesn’t matter who wins. I just think it would be fun to play together again, even from far away.
<br><br>
If you would like to try, please let me know. I’m okay with either color.
<br><br>
Your cousin
